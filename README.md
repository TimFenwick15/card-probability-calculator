This is a probability calculator for Collectable Card Games.

Currently, it can calculate the probability of drawing a card given the number of copies in your deck, the number of cards in your deck and the number of cards you are drawing.

Coming soon: Calculating the probability of drawing combinations of cards. For example, your deck contains 3 copies of card A and 2 copies of card B. What is the probability of drawing both of these cards given the same parameters as above.

In the future, the goal is to have a GUI that lets you build a process for calculating useful probabilities involved in CCG deck construction.

There will be presets based on the game you play that include the ability to add common cards that increase or decrease your odds of seeing particular combinations of cards.
